<h1>Eye Controlled Mouse Pointer</h1>
<ul><li>The project focuses on developing an eye-tracking system that allows users to control a computer cursor using their eye movements.</li></ul>
<ul><li>This is accomplished by leveraging computer vision techniques and the Mediapipe library to detect facial landmarks, specifically focusing on the eyes.</li></ul> 
<ul><li>The system captures real-time video from a webcam, processes it to detect eye positions, and translates these positions into cursor movements on the screen.</li></ul>  
<ul><li>Additionally, specific eye blinks are recognized as click actions, making the system an innovative solution for hands-free computer interaction.</li></ul>
