The project focuses on developing an eye-tracking system that allows users to control a computer cursor using their eye movements. 
This is accomplished by leveraging computer vision techniques and the Mediapipe library to detect facial landmarks, specifically focusing on the eyes. 
The system captures real-time video from a webcam, processes it to detect eye positions, and translates these positions into cursor movements on the screen. 
Additionally, specific eye blinks are recognized as click actions, making the system an innovative solution for hands-free computer interaction.
