<h1>Eye Controlled Mouse Pointer</h1>
The project focuses on developing an eye-tracking system that allows users to control a computer cursor using their eye movements.<br> 
This is accomplished by leveraging computer vision techniques and the Mediapipe library to detect facial landmarks, specifically focusing on the eyes.<br>  
The system captures real-time video from a webcam, processes it to detect eye positions, and translates these positions into cursor movements on the screen.<br>  
Additionally, specific eye blinks are recognized as click actions, making the system an innovative solution for hands-free computer interaction.<br>
